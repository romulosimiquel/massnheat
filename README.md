<h2>Mass and Heat stuff</h2>

This repository is about heat and mass transfer, one of my favorite subjects at college.
I'll be posting some equations and some stuff to help stundents.

Any suggestion or request feel free to ask.

My first commit is simple equation about condution heat transfer, it's a unidirectional flow through a wall.
